Logic Behind This Solution
--------------------------

Instead of finding the star condition directly, I first found the
leading-space condition.

1. Observe the number of leading spaces in each row.
2. Derive a formula for the spaces:
       spaces = Math.abs(mid - i)
3. The j-loop runs only until the last required column:
       lastColumn = num - 1 - spaces
4. During each iteration:
       - If j < spaces, print spaces.
       - Otherwise (j >= spaces), print stars.

How I Derived the Formula
-------------------------
I wrote down the ending boundary (last star position) for every row and
compared it with the row number (i). From this observation, I found the
relationship:

       lastColumn = num - 1 - Math.abs(mid - i)

After finding the boundary, printing the pattern became straightforward.

Key Learning
------------
For symmetric patterns like Diamond, Hourglass, and Butterfly,
it is often easier to:
    1. Find the leading spaces.
    2. Find the ending boundary.
    3. Print stars between those boundaries.

This approach helps derive the pattern logically instead of memorizing
conditions.

                if(j<Math.abs(num/2-i))
                    System.out.print("  ");
